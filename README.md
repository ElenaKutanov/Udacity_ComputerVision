### Project: Landmark Detection & Tracking
(SLAM, Python)

Implemented SLAM, a robust method for tracking an object over time and mapping out its surrounding environment, using elements of probability, motion models, and linear algebra

### Project: Image Captioning
(CNN, RNN, Python)

Trained a CNN-RNN model to predict captions for a given image. The main task was implementing an effective RNN decoder for a CNN encoder

### Project: Facial Keypoint Detection
(CNN, Python)

Created a CNN for detecting facial key points (eyes, mouth, nose, etc.)
